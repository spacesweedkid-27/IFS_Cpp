# IFS_Cpp
I made basically the same project 2 years ago in school, so I did it again, but a bit cleaner and (hopefully) way faster, because it's in Cpp and not Java.

Creates IFS's and generates data from them, and plots them in ppm format directly or in png format if exported (very slow)

When you plot your first IFS's you'll see...

TODO: Maybe add rotation.
